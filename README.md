### Getting Started 
* Get an API key from [Yelp](https://api.yelp.com) (sign up for an account and make a new app)
* Check the source above if you need a code snippet or the [JSON](https://github.com/gtokman/FoodHub/blob/master/FoodHub/API/JSON/API.json) used to generate models
* Dependencies used [Quicktype](https://app.quicktype.io/), [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)
* We're using Swift Package Manager ([SPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/)) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage dependencies
